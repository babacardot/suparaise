Based on the field description, determine which data key from the payload would be the best match. Consider:
- Semantic meaning (e.g., "Company Name" matches "company_name")
- Common variations (e.g., "Startup Name" also matches "company_name") 
- Field context (e.g., "Tell us about your company" could match "company_description_long")
- Business context (e.g., "Founder Name" matches "lead_founder_name")

Return the best matching data key, a confidence score (0-100), and your reasoning. If no good match exists, return null for bestMatch and score 0.`

- If specific data isn't available, provide a professional response based on context
- For open-ended questions, synthesize multiple data points into a coherent answer
